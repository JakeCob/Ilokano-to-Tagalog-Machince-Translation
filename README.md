## Background

This project aims to provide a machine translation tool for Ilokano and Tagalog languages, which are widely spoken in the Philippines. The tool uses a combination of example-based, rule-based, and statistical machine translation models to provide accurate and fluent translations.

## Installation

To install the dependencies, run the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage Instruction
--------------
1. Check [Dependencies](#dependencies) for the required tools needed, install it then set up.
2. Import the necessary modules.
3. Run the python notebook on Jupyter Notebook. 
4. Enter "http://127.0.0.1:5000" at your browsers URL

## Models

The project uses a combination of example-based, rule-based, and statistical machine translation models. The models are trained on a dataset of Ilokano-Tagalog parallel sentences.

## Evaluation

The translation tool has been evaluated on a test set of Ilokano-Tagalog sentences, achieving an BLEU score of x% for Ilokano to Tagalog and y% for Tagalog to Ilokano.
